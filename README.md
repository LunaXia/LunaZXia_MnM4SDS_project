# Spatiotemporal patterns of drug activities in Chicago

This is the repo of final project for course GOEG 788P Models & Methods for Spatial Data Science.

Three hypotheses were put forward in this project. The first one is that the spatial patterns of drug activities in city areas are significantly clustered; the second one is that drug arrests is an effective proxy of drug activities; the last one is that the spatial patterns of drug activities are correlated with built environment, demographic and socioeconomic factors.
